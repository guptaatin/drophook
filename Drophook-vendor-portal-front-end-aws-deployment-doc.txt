We will be deploying our front-end using github and aws amplify, the amplify service of aws is a baas(Backend as a service) behaves as paas similar as Amazon Web Service (Iaas)
and Microsoft Windows Azure(Paas). We can deploy front-end as well as back-end service to amplify, we will be connectiong our github repository to the aws amplifyand deploying 
our dev branch. Steps below discussed for the deployment:

Step1: In the AWS Amplify service console, select "Get Started" under Deploy.
Step2: Select GitHub as the repository service and select Continue.
Step3: Authenticate with GitHub and return to the Amplify console. Choose the repository and master branch you created earlier,
then select Next.
Step4: Accept the default build settings and select Next.
Step5: Review the final details and select Save and Deploy.
Step6: AWS Amplify will now build your source code and deploy your app at https://...amplifyapp.com.
Step7: Once the build completes, select the thumbnail to see your web app up and running live. 

Automatic deployment of code will be done as the changes in the code pushed to the github repository and the changes will be 
reflecting after the successfull build generation.

Amplify provides Static web hosting which is described below:
Static Web Hosting
AWS Amplify Console is priced for two features â€’ build & deploy, and hosting. For the build & deploy feature the price per build minute is $0.01. For the hosting feature the price per GB served is $0.15 and price per GB stored is $0.023.
With the AWS Free Usage Tier, you can get started for free. Upon sign up, new AWS customers receive 1,000 build minutes per month for the build and deploy feature, and 15 GB served per month and 5 GB data storage per month **for the hosting feature.

Pricing examples (outside free tier):
Example 1:
A startup team with 5 developers have an app that has 300 daily active users. The team commits code 2 times per day.
Monthly build & deploy charges

Assumptions: Average build time = 3 mins; Number of work days/month = 20
Total build time per month = num of devs * num of commits/day * num of days * avg. build time = 5*2*20*3 = 600 build mins per month
Monthly build & deploy charges = 600*.01 = $6
Monthly hosting charges

Assumptions: Web app size = 25 MB, average size of page requested = 1.5 MB
Monthly GB served = Daily active users * average page size * days = 300 * (1.5/1024) * 30 = 13.18 GB
Monthly GB stored = web app size * number of monthly builds = (25/1024)*(5*2*20) = 4.88 GB
Monthly hosting charges = 13.18*$0.15 + 4.88*$0.023= $1.97 + $0.11 = $2.08
Total monthly charges
Total charges = Build & deploy charges + Hosting charges = $6+$2.08 = $8.08 per month

Example 2:
A web app has 10,000 daily active users and is updated 2 times per month
Monthly build & deploy charges

Assumptions: Average build time = 3 mins
Total build time per month = num of updates/month * avg. build time = 2*3 = 6 build mins per month
Monthly build & deploy charges = 6*.01 = $0.06
Monthly hosting charges

Assumptions: Web app size = 100 MB, average size of page requested = 1.5 MB
Monthly GB served = Daily active users * average page size * days = 10,000 * (1.5/1024) * 30 = 439.45 GB
Monthly GB stored = web app size * number of monthly builds = (100/1024)*2 = 0.19 GB
Monthly hosting charges = 439.45*$0.15 + 0.19*$0.023= $65.92
Total monthly charges
Total charges = Build & deploy charges + Hosting charges = $0.06+$65.92 = $65.98 per month
